## How to Run Locally (IMPORTANT)

This project **must be opened using a local server**, not by double-clicking `index.html`, because some features (like the weather API and geolocation) require `http://localhost`.

### Option 1 (Recommended – VS Code)
1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Install the **Live Server** extension
3. Right-click `index.html`
4. Click **Open with Live Server**

### Option 2 (Python)
Run this in your terminal inside the project folder:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open:

http://localhost:8000
